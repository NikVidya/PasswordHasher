PasswordHasher takes an ordinary password and combines it with a given salt to generate an MD5 hash in the same way Unix stores its password hashes.

This can be used to generate highly secure passwords from less secure ones. It also gives you the ability to use one password, with a unique password for each place of use.

The salts you enter are saved, allowing you to store them for each place of use.

The Send button allows you to transport the hash without use of the insecure clipboard.
